Things I did today to setup this webpage:

Motivation - Watched Lesson 0 for fast.ai and decided to setup a blog

- Tried setting things up on fastpages, and realized it is deprecated
- Quarto is the suggested new way, owing to its ability to document code and prose together in conjunction with nbdev  - read more here: https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095
- Downloaded Quarto, and created an initial project on my terminal - https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html
- Created a new repo in Github to publish this to Github pages - following the steps here: https://pages.github.com/
- Had to create a new ssh key, as github as deprecated password based login directly from terminal - Figured this out using chatgpt to create a new rsa token, and link it to my Github profile, for remote ssh to the repo
- Finally pushed the local repo to the main branch, and voila, My blog "beginnerbunny.github.io" is ready
